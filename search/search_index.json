This resembles SMART on FHIR spec   (SoF) but is not limited to it. In particular, some access-checker plugins may   rely on extra claims in the access token not defined in SoF.

In particular, the focus is on web or mobile apps used by healthcare workers (HCW) who are often in low connectivity settings. For example a community health worker (CHW) collects data from patients and needs to sync that data with a central FHIR store. While our design is meant to be generic, we want to have great support for apps built on top of the Android FHIR SDK (\"the SDK\"). Data collected by all CHWs is centralized in a backend FHIR store (a.k.a., resource server, e.g., a GCP FHIR store or a HAPI FHIR server). The core issue is how to securely synchronize data between the FHIR store and the devices (the data-sync problem). The security question has three main components:</p> <ol> <li>[authentication] Who the user is? How do we establish the identity of     the end-user?</li> <li>[authorization] Given the identity of the user, what accesses are     granted to them? For example, a program administrator may have access to all     data while a CHW only has access to certain patient information in their own     catchment area.</li> <li>[access-control] How do we impose restrictions on FHIR store access     based on authorization credentials? For example, how do we make sure that an     authorized CHW can only access data for their own catchment area.</li> </ol> <p>The third component (i.e., the access-control) is the main focus of this design doc. The authentication and authorization parts are very much related to each other and we may refer to them collectively as authorization or \"auth\". For the auth problem, we only consider OAuth 2.0 based solutions and in particular we try to follow SMART on FHIR (SoF) spec for two main reasons:</p> <ol> <li>If we implement SoF support, it opens up the possibility of incorporating     many other SoF based applications with the FHIR-store. Consider a     practitioner that can easily use a 3rd party growth chart app on the data     they have already collected through their FHIR SDK based app.</li> <li>SoF is becoming the FHIR community's standard to build client apps on top of     FHIR-stores. So while in some places we have to deviate from that spec     because of its shortcomings, in many other places, we can simply follow the     recommendations of the spec to benefit from best practices.</li> </ol> <p>Note that the more difficult part of the problem that we are trying to solve is access-control which is not directly addressed by SoF, as clearly stated in section 3.0.1.1 of the current spec:</p> <p>\"Neither SMART on FHIR nor the FHIR Core specification provide a way to model the \"underlying\" permissions at play here; this is a lower-level responsibility in the access control stack. As such, clients can attempt to perform FHIR operations based on the scopes they are granted \u2014 but depending on the details of the underlying permission system (e.g., the permissions of the approving user and/or permissions assigned in a client-specific policy) these requests may be rejected, or results may be omitted from responses.\"</p>"},{"location":"design/#scenarios-and-constraints","title":"Scenarios and constraints","text":"<p>Some of the main scenarios that need to be supported are:</p> <ul> <li>[add-patient] A HCW registers a new patient, this needs to be sent to the   FHIR server.

In each case, we briefly describe what is supported in the first release of the access gateway. The \"first release\" is when we open-sourced the project in June 2022 in this GitHub repository. Let's first look at the architecture of the gateway. There are two main components:</p> <p>Server: The core of the access gateway is the \"server\" which provides a servlet that processes FHIR queries and an authorization interceptor that inspects those. The interceptor decodes and validates the JWT access-token and makes a call to an AccessChecker plugin to decide whether access should be granted or not. The server also provides common FHIR query/resource processing, e.g., PatientFinder for finding patient context. These libraries are meant to be used in the plugin implementations.</p> <p>AccessChecker plugin: Each access gateway needs at least one AccessChecker plugin. Gateway implementers can provide their customized access-check logic in this plugin. The server code's initialization finds plugins by looking for AccessCheckerFactory implementations that are @Named. The specified name is used to select that plugin at runtime. Example implementations are ListAccessChecker and PatientAccessChecker. AccessChecker plugins can send RPCs to other backends if they need to collect extra information. In our examples, the plugins consult with the same FHIR store that resources are pulled from, but you could imagine consulting more hardened storage solutions dedicated to maintaining access control rules.</p> <p>With this general architecture in mind, now let's look at different access-control methods.</p>"},{"location":"design/#patient-context-enforcement","title":"Patient context enforcement","text":"<p>Most of the use-cases we have can be handled if we limit a query to a single patient's resource. For example an Observation search query with a <code>patient=PID</code> query parameter, guarantees that the result is for the given patient.</p> <p>The mapping from resources to patients is done through the patient compartment definition. Note that we can still access many resources in one query; in particular through Patient/ID/$everything queries, we can fetch all updates for a single patient.</p> <p>This approach helps support both the flexible-access-control and untrusted-app items from the constraints section. Note to use this approach for access-control, the patient context should be inferred from the FHIR query. The server provides a library for doing this.</p>"},{"location":"design/#query-templates-allowedblocked-list","title":"Query templates allowed/blocked list","text":"<p>We may need to expose FHIR data that cannot be represented in a patient compartment query. For example, fetching a particular non-patient resource that is needed on the client side. For these we propose using a small set of allowed query templates. We can also have a list of blocked templates that may even apply to patient queries. For example, one implementation may decide to disable reverse chaining by blocking queries with <code>_has</code> query parameters (note this is disabled by default in the first release for security reasons described in the appendix.</p> <p>A notable item needed in the allowed-list for a HAPI FHIR server is the search page pattern. These queries with a <code>_getpages</code> query parameter identify cached search results of a previous query. Just from these queries, we cannot decide what the patient context is, so we should let those queries go through (there is a security risk here but since <code>_getpages</code> param values are ephemeral UUIDs, this is probably ok). Here is a sample config for this. We note that we want our core \"server\" to be stateless (for easy scalability); therefore cannot store next/prev URLs from previous query results.</p>"},{"location":"design/#query-rewrite","title":"Query rewrite","text":"<p>We can add extra query parameters to a FHIR request to make sure it stays within the limits of the granted access. For example, we can add constraints to an Observation search query to exclude sensitive Observations. Or we can add security label constraints in a search query. Note this feature is not implemented in the first release.</p>"},{"location":"design/#post-processing-and-security-labels","title":"Post-processing and security labels","text":"<p>Another access-control option is to inspect the returned resources before sending them back to the client. So the access gateway fetches the resources and then checks if the user has access to those. For example, when fetching a resource by ID (e.g., <code>/Observation/obs-id</code>) it is impossible to determine the patient context from the query string. So we can fetch the resource and then check if the user is allowed to access the patient(s) referenced in that resource. Or we can apply security label constraints. Note these imply some non-trivial overhead work for processing FHIR resources.</p> <p>Note that even this kind of fine-grained control, does not address all of the sensitive-data scenarios because of reverse chaining (if we do not limit the structure of FHIR queries that the gateway accepts). So we still need some restrictions on the permitted queries as mentioned above.</p> <p>Among gateway interfaces, there is AccessDecision which is returned from a checkAccess. This interface has a postProcess method which can be used for post-processing of resources returned from the FHIR server.</p>"},{"location":"design/#the-sync-flow","title":"The sync. flow","text":"<p>Here is a demonstration of how a sample HCW app can fetch data from a FHIR server while access-control policies apply.</p> <ul> <li>The client app redirects the HCW to the \"auth server\" (AuthZ+IDP) to   authenticate the user and annotate their access tokens with required   authorization claims.</li> <li>The client fetches the access token from AuthZ.</li> <li>The client sends the access token along with a FHIR query to the access   gateway.</li> <li>The gateway verifies the token and checks that every resource accessed belongs   to a patient the client is authorized to access and/or is compatible with the   authorized templates.</li> <li>The gateway relays the query to the FHIR store.</li> <li>Upon the store's response, the gateway makes any post-processing required and   returns the outcome to the client.</li> </ul> <p>Through this process, add-patient, update-patient, and fetch-my-patients scenarios can be handled. To support sof-apps (assuming that the auth server supports SoF scopes), we should implement access control rules based on SoF scopes (which is provided in a plugin). One example of an auth server with SoF support is Keycloak with SoF extension.</p>"},{"location":"design/#relevant-documents-and-background-information","title":"Relevant documents and background information","text":"<ul> <li>FHIR Security page.</li> <li>A collection of resources about SMART on   FHIR from SMART Health.</li> <li>An   extension to Keycloak   to support SMART on FHIR claims.</li> <li>New version of SMART scopes and context document.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"design/#appendix","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"design/#fhir-query-examples-and-access-control-challenges","title":"FHIR query examples and access control challenges","text":"<p>To better understand the complexity we are dealing with, let's look at three FHIR search queries and options for dealing with them.
