# This is to craete a docker wrapper around an example configuration script.
# The configuration set the requirements needed for a patient list based access.

# Note the image is just for the configurator script which relies on `kcadm.sh`
# tool of Keycloak. It is not tied to `smart-keycloak` and should work for
# other Keycloak containers too. We use smart-keycloak as the base package
# for convenience.
# FROM quay.io/keycloak/keycloak
FROM quay.io/alvearie/smart-keycloak

ENV KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD="adminpass"

# By default, a test realm is created for list-based access controls.

# Setting SMART_REALM makes config changes in that realm for the sample
# Growth Chart app; this includes adding a user, client, etc. For simplicity,
# it uses the same username/password as the above realm. It is assumed that
# this realm is already created by the alvearie/keycloak-config image.

# Another option is to bring up the base Keycloak image separately then run
