# Sample Identity Provider and Authorization Server
This directory contains the docker configuration for a sample
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) server that can be used as the Identity
Provider (IDP) and Authorization server (AuthZ) companions of the FHIR proxy.

**NOTE:** This is just for test purposes; never use this configuration in
production without addressing security issues, in particular SSL access.

There are three components involved here which are all combined in
[config-compose.yaml](config-compose.yaml):
- The [Alvearie SMART Keycloak](https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir).
We could also use the base Keycloak image if the access-checker does not care
about [SMART on FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/) spec (for
example the
[`list` access-checker](../../plugins/src/main/java/com/google/fhir/proxy/plugin/ListAccessChecker.java)).
The [`patient` access-checker](../../plugins/src/main/java/com/google/fhir/proxy/plugin/PatientAccessChecker.java)
is intended for a SMART on FHIR app with patient scopes.

- The `alvearie/keycloak-config:latest` docker image to configure a SMART
enabled realm. This is useful for the `patient` access-checker.

- The `gcr.io/second-scion-309318/keycloak-config:latest` docker image to configure a realm
for the `list` access-checker.

You can change the configuration parameters by changing environment variables
passed to the docker images. By default, the values in [`.env`](.env) is used.
To run all above components:
```shell
docker-compose -f config-compose.yaml up
```
