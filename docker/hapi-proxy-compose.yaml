# This is for easy creation and setup of a FHIR Proxy and HAPI FHIR Server
#
# The relevant environment variables are (see `.env` file for default values):
#
# TOKEN_ISSUER: URL of the Identity Provider server;
#  default: "http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/test"
#
# PROXY_TO: URL of the FHIR backend the proxy connects to;
#   default: "http://localhost:8099/fhir"
#
# BACKEND_TYPE: the FHIR backend type. Either GCP or HAPI; default: "HAPI"
#
# ACCESS_CHECKER: access checker to use when running the proxy; default: "list"
#
# RUN_MODE: Enforces proxy's token issuer check when set to "PROD". To bypass
#   the check, set to "DEV"; default: "PROD"
