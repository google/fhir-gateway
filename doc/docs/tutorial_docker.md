# Run the Info Gateway in Docker

In this guide, you will learn how to run FHIR Info Gateway in a Docker image,
and see it work in concert with a sample Keycloak and HAPI FHIR server running
on your local machine. We assume that
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are installed. The sample
commands are shown on a Linux/shell environment and may need to be adjusted for
your environment.

!!! tip "Important"

    The setup used in this guide **should not be used in a production environment**. It is designed to get things up and running quickly for demonstration or testing purposes only. The FHIR Information Gateway Docker image might be used in a production environment if deployed appropriately, however the example access-checker plugins may not satisfy real-world use cases.

## Start the Docker images

1. Clone the
   [FHIR Info Gateway repo from GitHub](https://github.com/google/fhir-gateway).
2. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the directory where you cloned the repo.
3. Bring up the sample Keycloak service using `docker compose`.

   ```shell
   docker compose -f docker/keycloak/config-compose.yaml up
   ```

   This runs an instance of [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) with
   [SoF extension](https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir),
   preloaded with a test configuration. It is accessible at
   `http://localhost:9080`.

4. Run the sample HAPI FHIR server Docker image.

   ```shell
   docker run -p 8099:8080 us-docker.pkg.dev/fhir-proxy-build/stable/hapi-synthea:latest
   ```

   The server is preloaded with synthetic patient data and a FHIR
   `List/patient-list-example` resource.

5. Run the FHIR Information Gateway Docker image with the `list` access checker.

   ```shell
   docker run \
     -e TOKEN_ISSUER=http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/test \
     -e PROXY_TO=http://localhost:8099/fhir \
     -e BACKEND_TYPE=HAPI \
     -e RUN_MODE=PROD \
     -e ACCESS_CHECKER=list \
     -e AUDIT_EVENT_ACTIONS_CONFIG=CRUDE \
     --network=host \
     us-docker.pkg.dev/fhir-proxy-build/stable/fhir-gateway:latest
   ```

   !!! tip "Docker Host Networking Note"

   The `--network=host` flag is used to allow the FHIR Information Gateway
   container to access services running on the host machine (Keycloak and HAPI
   FHIR server in this case). This flag works on Linux hosts. If you are using
   Docker Desktop on Windows or Mac, you may need to replace `localhost` with
   `host.docker.internal` in the environment variable values above and remove
   the `--network=host` flag. Alternatively for Docker Desktop versions 4.34 and
   later, you can enable
   [host networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/#docker-desktop).

Several environment variables are used to configure FHIR Information Gateway:

- `TOKEN_ISSUER`: The URL of the token issuer. For Keycloak this is typically
  `http://{keycloak-host}:{keycloak-port}/auth/realms/{realm-name}`.
- `PROXY_TO`: The [Service Base URL](https://build.fhir.org/http.html#root) of
  the FHIR server that FHIR Access Proxy communicates with.
- `BACKEND_TYPE`: One of `HAPI` for a HAPI FHIR Server or `GCP` for a Cloud
  Healthcare FHIR-store.
- `RUN_MODE`: One of `PROD` or `DEV`. DEV removes validation of the issuer URL,
  which is useful when using the docker image with an Android emulator as the
  emulator runs on its own virtual network and sees a different address than the
  host.
- `ACCESS_CHECKER`: The access-checker plugin to use. The Docker image includes
  the
  [`list`](https://github.com/google/fhir-gateway/blob/main/plugins/src/main/java/com/google/fhir/gateway/plugin/ListAccessChecker.java)
  and
  [`patient`](https://github.com/google/fhir-gateway/blob/main/plugins/src/main/java/com/google/fhir/gateway/plugin/PatientAccessChecker.java)
  example access-checkers.
- `AUDIT_EVENT_ACTIONS_CONFIG`: A flag to configure AuditEvent logging. Set to
  either `C`,`R`,`U`,`D`,`E` or all of them to enable and select the audit event
  actions to be logged. This model is guided by the value set codes defined
  here - https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-audit-event-action.html. Absence of
  any (valid) means audit logging is disabled.

!!! tip "GCP Note"

    If the FHIR server is GCP FHIR-store and the gateway is not run on a VM with proper service account (e.g., running on a localhost), you need to pass GCP credentials to it, for example by mapping the `.config/gcloud` volume (i.e., add `-v ~/.config/gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud` to the above command).

## Examine the sample Keycloak configuration

In this section you will review the Keycloak settings relevant to the FHIR
Information Gateway with the sample `list` access checker plugin.

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9080/auth/admin/`.
2.  Login using user `admin` and password `adminpass`.
3.  Select the `test` realm.
4.  From the left menu, find the **Manage** section and click **Users**. Click
    **View all users**, then click the **ID** of the only result to view the
    user `Testuser`.
5.  Select the **Attributes** tab. Note the attribute `patient_list` with value
    `patient-list-example`. The client `my-fhir-client` has a corresponding
    [User Attribute mapper](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_protocol-mappers)
    to add this as a claim to the access token JWT, which you can see under
    **Clients > my-fhir-client > Mappers > list-mapper**.
6.  `patient-list-example` is the ID of a FHIR List resource which lists all the
    Patient resources the user can access. Open
    `http://localhost:8099/fhir/List/patient-list-example` to see the list
    referencing two Patients:

    ```json
    ...
    "entry": [ {
      "item": {
        "reference": "Patient/75270"
      }
    }, {
      "item": {
        "reference": "Patient/3810"
      }
    } ]
    ...
    ```

## Get a FHIR resource using FHIR Information Gateway

1.  Get an access token for the test user. This command uses
    [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to parse the access token from the JSON
    response.

    ```shell
    ACCESS_TOKEN="$( \
      curl -X POST \
          -d 'client_id=my-fhir-client' \
          -d 'username=testuser' \
          -d 'password=testpass' \
          -d 'grant_type=password' \
          "http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/test/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
        | jq .access_token \
        | tr -d '"' \
    )"
    ```

    You will need to rerun this command when the access token expires after 5
    minutes. In a real application, implement your Identity Provider's
    authentication flow, including refresh tokens.

2.  Send a request to FHIR Information Gateway using the access token.

    ```shell
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
    'http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/75270'
    ```

    You should get a response containing the Patient resource.

3.  Send a second request for a patient the user does not have access to.

    ```shell
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
    'http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/3'
    ```

    You should get a response of
    `User is not authorized to GET http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/3`.

4.  For the first patient that the user had access to, confirm an AuditEvent
    resource was created.

    ```shell
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
    'http://localhost:8099/fhir/AuditEvent?patient=75270'
    ```

    You should get a response with an AuditEvent resource (contained in a Bundle
    resource) that logs the read access to the Patient resource.
